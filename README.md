# Project Karaoke(Name TBD)
by Ashley Kim, Andre Amante, Andrei Dimaano, Roy Feng

## Background
If you want to sing karaoke at home, there are several YouTube Channels like [Sing King](https://www.youtube.com/c/singkingkaraoke/videos) and [TJ Karaoke](https://www.youtube.com/c/TJ%EB%85%B8%EB%9E%98%EB%B0%A9TJKaraoke) that host karaoke videos. These channels upload videos daily or weekly with the newest songs, usually requested by viewers in the comments section. Creating these videos is tedious work because you have to download the instrumental track, edit the timing of the lyrics, as well as add in your own vocal backings.

However, these videos are really structured. There's little room for any user customizability. For example, if you really like tik tok sped up songs, there's no karaoke for that. If you really like another artist's rendition of a song, there's usually no karaoke for that. 

## Proposal
We are building a system that brings karaoke creation to the public and karaoke singing to your web browser. This project is significant because it requires a lot of engineering and designing. We're building a website that can act as a social network. We're also creating algorithms that transform user input into a karaoke video. Developing and designing these algorithms and the data structures required for these algorithms is a significant challenge. We're also dealing with designing a database to handle user data, karaoke data, and interaction data.

## Tools
- React / Next.js
- [Mantine UI Library](https://mantine.dev/)
- Supabase / MongoDB 
- AWS
- Netlify

(stretch goals)
- Whisper Library
- Pytorch

## Final Vision 
We plan to build the following features for our product (Name TBD):
1. Home Page will display all of the karaoke videos
2. Users can sign up on the website and create profiles. 
3. Users can like and comment on different karaoke videos 
4. Users can create playlists of karaoke videos
5. Users can customize the background of their karaoke videos.
6. Users can add their spotify playlists to their account and the website will show videos based on their spotify playlists
7. Users can create their own karaoke videos and share them to the public
8. Users can add other users

Stretch Goals:
1. Build a recommendation system using metadata from interactions
2. Autogenerate karaoke videos using AI libraries

## First Half Vision

2. Website First Draft Design and Implementation design and implementation can be done in parallel
3. Home Page Design and Implementation
4. User Sign up
5. Displaying Karaoke Songs
6. Creating Karaoke Video
